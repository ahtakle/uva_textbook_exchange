UVA Textbook Exchange is an accessible and VERY well-designed web application allowing students to tit for tat their textbooks among other undergraduates.

"This website is so good, it doesn't run on just one service. You need to run it on Apache AND Tomcat to get it to function."
- Aditi Takle (2018), co-founder of UVA Textbook exchange
"Who needs one backend language when you can have five?"
